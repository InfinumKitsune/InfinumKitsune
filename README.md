- 👋 Hi, I’m @InfinumKitsune
- 👀 I’m interested in a vast variety of things, but mostly gaming, coding, mythology, art, survivalism, and weaponry of all sorts (not in that particular order either).
- 🌱 I’m currently going through school for software engineering. Wish me luck.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game if anyone has one in the works and needs design help.
- 📫 How to reach me ... If you need to, you already know how.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Oh I'm full of these... Let's see... If you have ever had anything banana flavored and went, 'This doesn't taste like bananas.' that's because the banana flavored things like candies are actually made from other kinds of bananas that aren't typically
- eaten in most countries.
-   If you were hoping for a fun fact about me then, fun fact: I'm full of useless knowledge.
